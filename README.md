Matlab and python scripts that solve the Falkner-Skan equation. The folder 'coupled falkner-skan equation' solves 2 couple equations' the falkner-skan (f'''+ff''=b(f'^2-1-S)) and the polhausen equation (s''+fS'=0 ) using the shooting method. The other folder 'Falkner-Skan' only solves the Falkner-Skan equation.
